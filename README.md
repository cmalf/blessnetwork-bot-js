> [!WARNING]
> ## Bot not working!
> ##  They added signature for PING request process in Extension v0.1.8!
> ##  I tried to create signature using @noble/secp256k1,@noble/hasses/hmac but it still failed
> ##  Maybe there is an error when I decrypt EncryptedPrivateKey using a method similar to their Unmarshal method.
> ##  I still haven't found the right way to Decrypt PrivateKey to get valid signature
> ##  If you find the right way or method to decrypt PrivateKey please open the conversation in "Issues" session!
